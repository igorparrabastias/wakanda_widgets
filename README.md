# wakanda_widgets

* I try and keep the widget bugfree, testing is usually done in applications, so its easier to pick up weird stuff.
* Dont blindly update widget, keep a copy of the old one you are using before you update, or atleast figure out what version you are at
* If you do find any bugs, then please report it, start with widget name, and version.
* Widgets are for wak10 +, they might work fine in wak9 also, I havent tested.
